# Passive-shimming-algorithm
The module for passive shimming algorithm

本项目基于Python语言进行编写，独立于无源匀场辅助软件，针对已有传感器采集数据进行无源匀场实验，对比不同算法下的匀场效果差异。项目提出了一种2-stage方案，对整数规划进行处理。

This project is written in Python, independent of passive shimming software, to conduct passive leveling experiments for existing sensor acquisition data and compare the difference of shimming effect under different algorithms. The project proposes a 2-stage scheme to process the integer planning. (Translated from DeepL)
